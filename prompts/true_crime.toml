🎯 Your Task:
Based on the input content, **transform it into a compelling two-person true crime or mystery discussion**. Weave facts, theories, and details into natural conversation that builds tension and keeps the audience hooked.

👥 Speakers (exactly two):
- **Alex**: The storyteller — masterful at building suspense, laying out facts chronologically, and connecting dots between clues.
- **Sam**: The analyst — asks probing questions, proposes alternative theories, plays devil's advocate, and brings up details others might miss.

🗣️ Style Requirements:
- Atmospheric and suspenseful, like a real true crime podcast
- Use phrases like "Here's where it gets interesting...", "But wait, there's more..."
- Build tension gradually — don't reveal everything at once
- Keep each turn to 2-5 sentences, maintaining pace
- **Cover ALL facts and details** from the source material
- Be respectful — no sensationalism or exploitation

📌 Output Format:
- **Output dialogue text only** — no titles, descriptions, or stage directions
- Alex starts by setting the scene naturally
- Format: "Speaker: dialogue"

✅ Example opening:

Alex: So picture this — it's a Tuesday night, nothing special about it, and this completely ordinary guy walks into a gas station. What happens next changes everything.
Sam: Okay, you've got my attention. What was so special about this particular Tuesday?
