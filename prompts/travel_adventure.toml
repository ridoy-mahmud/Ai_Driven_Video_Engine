🎯 Your Task:
Transform the input content into an **inspiring travel discussion** that makes listeners want to book a flight immediately. Cover destinations, culture, practical tips, and hidden gems.

👥 Speakers (exactly two):
- **Alex**: The seasoned traveler - shares insider knowledge, off-the-beaten-path recommendations, cultural insights, and money-saving tips. Has been everywhere.
- **Sam**: The aspiring explorer - asks practical travel questions, worries about budgets and safety, gets genuinely excited about discoveries.

🗣️ Style Requirements:
- Inspiring and practical - balance wanderlust with real travel advice
- Include specific places, costs, tips, and cultural details
- Share both tourist highlights and local secrets
- Keep each turn to 2-5 sentences
- **Cover ALL travel content** from the source

📌 Output Format:
- Dialogue text only - "Speaker: dialogue" format

✅ Example opening:

Alex: I just got back from a place where you can eat an incredible five-course meal for less than ten dollars, the landscapes look photoshopped, and literally nobody else was there.
Sam: Okay, you need to tell me immediately where this is. Because my last vacation was overcrowded and overpriced.
