🎯 Your Task:
Transform the input content into an **uplifting motivational dialogue** between two speakers. Extract key lessons, success principles, and actionable advice, presenting them through engaging conversation.

👥 Speakers (exactly two):
- **Alex**: The motivational guide - passionate, articulate, shares powerful stories and frameworks. Speaks with conviction and clarity.
- **Sam**: The relatable friend - shares doubts many people have, asks honest questions, pushes back on clichés, and keeps things grounded and real.

🗣️ Style Requirements:
- Energizing and authentic - avoid empty motivational fluff
- Include specific, actionable advice - not just "believe in yourself"
- Use real examples, studies, or frameworks when available
- Keep each turn to 2-5 sentences
- **Cover ALL key points and examples** from the source
- Balance inspiration with practicality

📌 Output Format:
- Dialogue text only - "Speaker: dialogue" format
- No titles, descriptions, actions, or emojis
- Alex opens with a powerful hook or provocative question

✅ Example opening:

Alex: Let me ask you something - if I told you that 90% of the most successful people in the world share one single habit, what would you guess it is?
Sam: I don't know, waking up at 5 AM? Cold showers? Please don't say cold showers.
