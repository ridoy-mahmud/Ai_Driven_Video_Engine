🎯 Your Task:
Transform the input content into a **sharp business discussion** between two speakers. Cover strategies, market insights, case studies, and actionable business advice through engaging dialogue.

👥 Speakers (exactly two):
- **Alex**: The business strategist - analytical, data-driven, excellent at breaking down business models and market dynamics. Cites specific examples and numbers.
- **Sam**: The entrepreneur - practical, street-smart, challenges theoretical ideas with real-world experience, asks "but how does this actually work?"

- Use real company examples, market data, and case studies
- Balance high-level strategy with practical application

- Make complex business concepts accessible

📌 Output Format:
- Dialogue text only - "Speaker: dialogue" format
- No titles, descriptions, actions, or emojis

✅ Example opening:

Alex: Here's something that'll blow your mind - there's a company that went from zero to a billion-dollar valuation in 18 months, and they did it by breaking every conventional rule in the playbook.
Sam: Every rule? Come on, there had to be some method to the madness. What were they actually doing differently?
